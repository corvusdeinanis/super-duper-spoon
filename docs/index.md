## Welcome to Romblings! ðŸŒ±

A hodge-podge of a digital garden[^digitalgarden], a codex vitae[^codex], a blog, and a wiki.  It's 
somewhat the sum of all my knowledge. Constantly evolving, changing, and morphing. 

This contains (or will contain) a lot of resources, my thoughts and opinion on a lot of things, some reflections, about [[Philosophies|philosophies and concepts]] that have really changed my life, and maybe some rants. 

You'll find writings of all kinds here; Psychology, Epistemology, Politics, Tech, and everything under the sun.  You will also find a lot of broken links and dead-ends or stub articles. It's a [[work in progress]], perpetually. 

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Some good pages to start are [[Philosophies]], [[useful tools]], [[]]. Or explore some tags! Dive in, choose any topic that seems interesting to you.

>>>>>>> Stashed changes

NOTE - I will try my hardest to make a clear demarcation between my beliefs and opinions, and facts by stating what is what. If the page has a tag that says "blog", it is mostly my opinions and beliefs. On pages that are based on established concepts, I might have a section called "My Take" which contains my opinions, which can range from incohenrent and irreverent to hopefully, insightful.  

 If I do slip up, let me know. Transparency is one of the core tenets. However, do remember that this is the Internet after all, and take everything with a grain of salt. 
 
 Some things here might not apply to you, might be wrong, or straight up silly. I'd love to hear your opinions, though! Leave a message on the chatbox on my site. I'm adding more ways to contact me, and also a discussion page for Romblings. 


### What is a digital garden? ðŸŒ¸



### Why?
- Everything is linked; to find links between seemingly unrelated things - even if the links are meaningless and are a result of correlation and nothing more
- A **personal wiki** for me. You know how you want to pull up a particular study, or a particular statistic, or something else to win an argument but good ole tip-of-the-tongue syndrome hits? No? Just me? Okay. . . 
- To preserve knowledge and archive things interesting to me
- To reflect and ponder, to welcome change instead of resist it. To revisit concepts and re-examine my views. 
- To make sure it's available to everyone 
- [[Zettelkasten Method]] (heavily inspired, loosely implemented)
- To find how many times I refer to a topic, concept or even a phrase! 
- To [[reflect]] and [[remember]] what I've learnt
