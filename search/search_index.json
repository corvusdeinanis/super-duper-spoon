If the page has a tag that says \"blog\", it is mostly my opinions and beliefs. On pages that are based on established concepts, I might have a section called \"My Take\" which contains my opinions, which can range from incohenrent and irreverent to hopefully, insightful.  </p> <p>If I do slip up, let me know.

America two dollars and twentyseven cents January 17, 1956.  I can\u2019t stand my own mind. America when will we end the human war? Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb. I don\u2019t feel good don\u2019t bother me. I won\u2019t write my poem till I\u2019m in my right mind. America when will you be angelic? When will you take off your clothes? When will you look at yourself through the grave? When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites? America why are your libraries full of tears? America when will you send your eggs to India? I\u2019m sick of your insane demands. When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks? America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world.  Your machinery is too much for me. You made me want to be a saint. There must be some other way to settle this argument.  Burroughs is in Tangiers I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll come back it\u2019s sinister.  Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke?  I\u2019m trying to come to the point. I refuse to give up my obsession. America stop pushing I know what I\u2019m doing. America the plum blossoms are falling. I haven\u2019t read the newspapers for months, everyday somebody goes on trial for murder. America I feel sentimental about the Wobblies. America I used to be a communist when I was a kid I\u2019m not sorry.  I smoke marijuana every chance I get. I sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet.  When I go to Chinatown I get drunk and never get laid.  My mind is made up there\u2019s going to be trouble. You should have seen me reading Marx. My psychoanalyst thinks I\u2019m perfectly right. I won\u2019t say the Lord\u2019s Prayer. I have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations. America I still haven\u2019t told you what you did to Uncle Max after he came over from Russia. I\u2019m addressing you. Are you going to let your emotional life be run by Time Magazine?  I\u2019m obsessed by Time Magazine. I read it every week. Its cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore.  I read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library. It\u2019s always telling me about responsibility. Businessmen are serious. Movie producers are serious. Everybody\u2019s serious but me.  It occurs to me that I am America. I am talking to myself again. </p> <p>Asia is rising against me. I haven\u2019t got a chinaman\u2019s chance. I\u2019d better consider my national resources. My national resources consist of two joints of marijuana millions of genitals an unpublishable private literature that jetplanes 1400 miles an hour and twentyfive-thousand mental institutions. I say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of underprivileged who live in my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns. I have abolished the whorehouses of France, Tangiers is the next to go. My ambition is to be President despite the fact that I\u2019m a Catholic. America how can I write a holy litany in your silly mood? I will continue like Henry Ford my strophes are as individual as his automobiles more so they\u2019re all different sexes. America I will sell you strophes $2500 apiece $500 down on your old strophe America free Tom Mooney America save the Spanish Loyalists America Sacco &amp; Vanzetti must not die America I am the Scottsboro boys. America when I was seven momma took me to Communist Cell meetings they sold us garbanzos a handful per ticket a ticket costs a nickel and the speeches were free everybody was angelic and sentimental about the workers it was all so sincere you have no idea what a good thing the party was in 1835 Scott Nearing was a grand old man a real mensch Mother Bloor the Silk-strikers\u2019 Ewig-Weibliche made me cry I once saw the Yiddish orator Israel Amter plain. Everybody must have been a spy. America you don\u2019t really want to go to war. America its them bad Russians. Them Russians them Russians and them Chinamen. And them Russians.  The Russia wants to eat us alive. The Russia\u2019s power mad. She wants to take our cars from out our garages. Her wants to grab Chicago. Her needs a Red Reader\u2019s Digest. Her wants our auto plants in Siberia. Him big bureaucracy running our fillingstations. That no good. Ugh. Him make Indians learn read. Him need big black niggers. Hah. Her make us all work sixteen hours a day. Help.  America this is quite serious. America this is the impression I get from looking in the television set.  America is this correct? I\u2019d better get right down to the job. It\u2019s true I don\u2019t want to join the Army or turn lathes in precision parts factories, I\u2019m nearsighted and psychopathic anyway.
