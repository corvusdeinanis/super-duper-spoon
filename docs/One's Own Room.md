1. setting - **Oxbridge -> Fictional college**
   Mrs Beton had to present on "Women and Fiction"
   Visits Oxbridge - Beautiful campus
   Sat in a nearby garden; walked on the grass - was interrupted and was told she wasn't allowed, only for research scholars

Intellectual freedom depends on material things
Poetry depends upon intellectual freedom
And woman always have been poor, not for 200 years but from the beginning of time. Women have not had a dog's chance of writing poetry. This is why I am laid so much focus on money and a room of one's own.
